# Twitter during New Year's Eve 2015-2016

In this project, we have queried Twitter's API during New Year's Eve 2015-2016 from approximately 11pm UK time, for a period of over 12 hours. Our initial intention was to run a basic sentiment analysis, but we've complemented this with an analysis of the location of tweets sent from all over the world, and the identification of the respective languages in which the tweets were written. 

Please navigate through the files for the python and R scripts, and check some of the images the code can produce.
